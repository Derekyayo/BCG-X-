Churning the Odds: Predicting Customer Retention at PowerCo
üöÄ Project Overview
In the highly competitive energy utility landscape, customer churn isn't just a metric ‚Äì it's a critical threat to revenue and stability. This project tackles exactly that challenge for PowerCo, a major gas and electricity provider, by leveraging advanced data science techniques to identify and predict at-risk customers before they leave.

As a Data Scientist at BCG X, my mission was to dive deep into PowerCo's operational data, uncover the hidden signals of churn, and develop a robust system to proactively identify customers on the brink of departure.

üéØ The Challenge: Retaining PowerCo's Valued Customers
PowerCo faced a common dilemma: how to stem the tide of departing customers and protect their bottom line. The goal was not just to react to churn, but to anticipate it, allowing for targeted intervention and improved customer satisfaction. This project outlines the systematic approach taken to address this critical business problem.

üí° My Data Science Approach (BCG X Methodology)
Following BCG X's rigorous 5-step methodology, this project systematically moved from foundational problem understanding to building a powerful predictive model and deriving actionable insights:
Business Understanding & Problem Framing: Deciphering the "why" behind churn and framing the analytical challenge.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning: Transforming raw client data into a pristine, insightful foundation.
Feature Engineering: Crafting powerful new variables from existing data to enhance predictive power.
Modeling & Evaluation: Building and validating a robust predictive model for churn risk.
Insights & Recommendations: Translating complex predictions into clear, business-relevant strategies.

üõ† Key Project Milestones & What I Did
This project was a deep dive into the practical application of data science, covering the entire lifecycle from initial problem definition to model deployment.
Phase 1: Laying the Foundation & Strategic Planning
Understanding the Business Context: Gained a deep understanding of PowerCo's operations, the utility market, and the nuances of customer churn within this sector.
Problem Decomposition: Broke down the complex challenge of churn into manageable, data-driven questions.
Data Requirements & Strategy: Determined the specific client data needed for analysis and outlined the sophisticated techniques to investigate PowerCo's problem, summarizing this approach in a strategic communication to the client.
Phase 2: Unveiling Insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Hypothesis Testing: Investigated whether price sensitivity was the most influential factor driving customer churn, using data-driven frameworks.
Python-Powered Analysis: Utilized Python to meticulously analyze client data, revealing underlying patterns and relationships.
Compelling Visualizations: Created insightful data visualizations to interpret key trends, making complex data accessible and highlighting potential churn indicators.
Phase 3: The Art of Feature Engineering
This crucial phase was about transforming raw data into powerful predictive features, a cornerstone for accurate machine learning models.
Strategic Data Transformation: Applied additions, deletions, combinations, and mutations to the dataset to improve model training and accuracy.
Hypothesis-Driven Feature Creation: Built new features specifically designed to test hypotheses and enhance the predictability of churn.
My Feature Engineering Framework:
Pruning Irrelevant Data: Identified and removed columns that were not relevant to the analysis, had low variance, or were redundant.
Expanding Dimensions: Derived richer features from existing data (e.g., extracting temporal components like month, day, year from date columns).
Crafting Synergistic Features: Combined existing columns to create 'better' columns that offered enhanced predictive power for churn.
Harmonizing Datasets: Successfully combined disparate datasets by identifying common keys, creating a unified and enriched analytical base.
This iterative process, grounded in strong business understanding, ensured every new feature brought us closer to accurate churn prediction.
Phase 4: Building the Churn Predictor: Predictive Modeling
Understanding Churn Risk: Gained hands-on experience in how predictive modeling can be used to accurately indicate customer churn risk.
Random Forest Implementation: Developed a robust churn prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier. This powerful supervised learning algorithm builds a multitude of decision trees on different samples of the data, taking a majority vote to arrive at highly accurate and reliable predictions of churn (0 = no churn, 1 = churn). The model was trained to identify the subtle indicators that differentiate loyal customers from those on the verge of leaving.

üíª Tech Stack
Python: The core language for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
Pandas: For efficient data structuring and transformation.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For creating insightful and compelling data visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the Random Forest Classifier and other machine learning utilities.
Jupyter Notebooks: For an interactive and iterative development workflow.

üìà Impact & Future Potential
This project lays the foundational groundwork for PowerCo to proactively engage with at-risk customers, potentially saving significant revenue and strengthening customer relationships. The identified insights and the developed predictive model serve as powerful tools for strategic decision-making and targeted retention campaigns, transforming reactive responses into proactive business growth.
